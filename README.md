# Universal Validation Specification

**Univalidate** is a specification with the goal of **standardizing 
validation** by creating a **language agnostic** validation schema.
This solves the problem of validation functioning differently between 
the frontend and backend of a system.

This specification is an early draft and is subject to change drastically
in the near future. Any feature requests or error reports should be raised as issues.

## Contents
